## Overview

I decided to stop my difficulty down to newbie and try my hand out at something easier. This challenge was to display an order summary with interactive elements. For that, I scaled the checkout button only. I didn't want to overwhelm with all sorts of fancy animations for other portions of the page. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

I designed this with a mobile first approach - getting the page looking presentable in a responsive layout before altering the page with an @media query for desktop.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

One thing I learned with this challenge is that transforms don't necessarily show up in a mobile verions of the page.

### Useful resources
I used one resource for this challenge: 

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org) - The Mozilla Developer Network.
